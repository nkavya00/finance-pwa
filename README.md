# finance-pwa
Finance Tracker is a lightweight Progressive Web App (PWA) that lets you quickly log spending data (description, amount, and card) into a connected Google Sheet via a serverless AWS Lambda endpoint. It supports offline usage by caching submissions locally when offline, then automatically syncing them when the app reconnects. Designed to be installable, mobile-friendly, and fast.
